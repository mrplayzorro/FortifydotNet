## Key Security Measures

### Security Measure 1: IP Monitoring and Rate Limiting

FortifydotNet meticulously monitors all incoming IPs, determines their general location, and scrutinizes their request frequency. If an IP exceeds a specified threshold, FortifydotNet promptly blocks it. Additionally, an optional captcha feature adds an extra layer of security.

### Security Measure 2: Captcha Prompt for High IP Counts

To prevent overwhelming traffic, FortifydotNet keeps track of the number of connected IPs. If this count surpasses the limit set by the website owner, users are prompted with a captcha from a separate server.

### Security Measure 3: Blocking VPNs, Proxies, and Spoofed IPs

FortifydotNet goes beyond traditional measures by identifying and blocking VPNs, proxies, and spoofed IPs, minimizing potential security vulnerabilities.

### Security Measure 4: Geographic Analysis

By compiling data from Security Measure 1, FortifydotNet creates a database highlighting countries with high connection frequencies. This feature aids website owners in understanding potential sources of DDoS attacks.
